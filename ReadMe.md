# Teaching Challenge

Here I wanted to challenge my teaching skills trying to explain a Data Science rookie how to use Python to visualize Facebook's share price over (the last) 30 days. 

Assuming the student has never visualized a data set (such as a CSV file) in Python before, the learning goal is to enable someone to later visualize stock prices on their own.
